The objective of this course is to examine the process of system analysis and design. Both the structured and object-oriented techniques of analysis and design are studied. The system development life cycle is introduced to gain an overall perspective on system development. Topics covered in the course: (i) determining organizational information requirements through interviews and company document analysis, (ii) current structured methodologies for systems analysis and design of information systems -- data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, data dictionaries, structured chart (iii)  current object-oriented  techniques for analysis and design -- use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams. These topics will be approached using a combination of lectures, readings, systems analysis exercises, and class discussions. Students are encouraged to apply the concepts learned in class to analyze systems in the real world. Students are to conduct a project to analyze and design a system in an area of their choice.The computer-aided  software, VISIBLE ANALYST, is used to help students to develop the systems.
